<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### Clone the back-end repository and set it up

```
git clone 
cd doctors_appointment_back_end
bundle install
```

#### Note: 
> Be sure to follow the setting-up instructions of the backend. It needs an .env file to connect to the local PostgreSQL database

After setting-up the back end:

### Run the backend repository (in port 3001)
```
rails s -p 3001
```
##### Note that the back-end repository runs in port 3001 (this is important because the `.env` file of the frontend reads from this port to run the app)

### Clone the Frontend repository (use the same shell)

```shell
cd ..
git clone 
cd doctors_appointment_front_end
```

### Install

- In the project directory, install the neccessary packages with the following command:

```
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```
> The --legacy-peer-deps options is because of using some older packages of react for using an older version of React

- After installing, run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

- You may also see any lint errors in the console.
```
npm test
````

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- For building the application for deployment:
```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
